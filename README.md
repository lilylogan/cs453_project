## Data:
### 1. Download the datasets from Kaggle (make sure that you store them in a directory named "data" for step 2)

- [30,000 Spotify Songs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/30000-spotify-songs/data)

### 2. Run each line in the jupyter notebook, "data_preprocessing.ipynb". This will clean the data and download a cleaned version.
